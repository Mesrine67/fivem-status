# Velocity Server Status

<h1> Discord status installation guide </h1>

The first step is to have your webhook link and enter it in line 5 of server.lua

Once the webhook link is entered, restart or start the script, a message will automatically be sent with a text that says: Copy this message id and put it into Config and restart script!
You will do what the message says, copy the ID of that message and paste it into Config.MessageId

and voila, now you can modify the status message in your own way, even add more jobs or functions

<h2> If you need support to configure the script, contact us through our discord https://discord.gg/ZME2MjD8D6 </h2>
